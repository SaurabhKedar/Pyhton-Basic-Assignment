    "Answer-\n",
    "       It helps to divide the large programs into small groups so that we can read the code, and debug the program faster and better. Functions stop us from writing the same logic various times. We can bind the logic in one def and then call the same over and over.\n",

    "Answer-\n",
    "       The code in afunction runs ,when the function is called.\n",
    "      When a function is called, the program control jumps to that function definition and executes the statements inside the function body. After executing the body of the function, the program control jumps back to the part of the program which called the function, and resumes execution at that point"

    "Answer-\n",
    "      A function is a named section of a code that performs a specific task. This typically involves taking some input, manipulating the input and returning an output.\n",
    "      While, A function call is a request made by a program or script that performs a predetermined function. In the example below, a batch file clears the screen and then calls another batch file.\n",
    "      Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call. So the difference between the function and function call is, A function is procedure to achieve a particular result while function call is using this function to achive that task."

    "Answer-\n",
    "      If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, Python will treat them as two separate variables, one available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function.\n",
    "      There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten.\n",
    "      When you use an unqualified name inside a function, Python searches three scopes—the local (L), then the global (G), and then the built-in (B)—and stops at the first place the name is found.\n",

    " Answer-   \n",
    "    Return values are just what they sound like — the values that a function returns when it has completed.\n",
    "    A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.\n",
    "    A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. ... If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n",
